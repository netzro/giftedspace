SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

But first, I needed to understand the notations used when solving the cube.\nUnderstanding Rubik\u0026rsquo;s Cube Notation When solving a Rubik\u0026rsquo;s Cube, algorithms are often represented using a specific notation. Here‚Äôs a quick guide that helped me understand the symbols:\nU (Up): Rotate the top face of the cube clockwise. U\u0026rsquo; (Up Prime): Rotate the top face of the cube counterclockwise. U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns). The same notation applies to other faces:\nR (Right): Rotate the right face of the cube clockwise.\nR\u0026rsquo; (Right Prime): Rotate the right face counterclockwise.\nR2 (Right Double): Rotate the right face 180 degrees.\nL (Left): Rotate the left face of the cube clockwise.\nL\u0026rsquo; (Left Prime): Rotate the left face counterclockwise.\nL2 (Left Double): Rotate the left face 180 degrees.\nF (Front): Rotate the front face of the cube clockwise.\nF\u0026rsquo; (Front Prime): Rotate the front face counterclockwise.\nF2 (Front Double): Rotate the front face 180 degrees.\nB (Back): Rotate the back face of the cube clockwise.\nB\u0026rsquo; (Back Prime): Rotate the back face counterclockwise.\nB2 (Back Double): Rotate the back face 180 degrees.\nD (Down): Rotate the bottom face of the cube clockwise.\nD\u0026rsquo; (Down Prime): Rotate the bottom face counterclockwise.\nD2 (Down Double): Rotate the bottom face 180 degrees.\nExample Algorithm An example of an algorithm might look like this:\nR U R\u0026#39; U\u0026#39; In the next post, I will start solving the cube.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/rc1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-cube\"\u003eThe Cube\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently, I decided to buy myself a Rubik\u0026rsquo;s Cube and see how easy or hard solving it would be.

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.

SSH keys provide a stronger layer of security compared to password logins by utilizing a cryptographic key pair. This guide will walk you through generating SSH keys, copying them to your server, and disabling password logins to enhance security.\nStep 1: Generate SSH Keys Before you can use SSH key-based authentication, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command to generate an SSH key pair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 This will generate a 4096-bit RSA key, which is secure and recommended for most uses.\nWhen prompted to enter a file in which to save the key, press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).\nYou can also set a passphrase for additional security, or press Enter to skip this step if you don‚Äôt want a passphrase.\nStep 2: Copy the SSH Key to Your VPS Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to your VPS so it knows to trust your key when you try to log in.\nUse the following command to copy your public key to the VPS:\nssh-copy-id your_user@your_vps_ip_address Make sure to replace your_user with the actual username on your VPS (if you don‚Äôt have a user yet, create one with adduser). Also, replace your_vps_ip_address with the actual IP address of your VPS.\nIf ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the public key by doing the following:\nDisplay your public key on your local machine:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Log into your VPS using your password and open the authorized keys file:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address mkdir -p ~/.ssh nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the public key into this file, save it, and exit.\nSet the correct permissions for the .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Disable Password Authentication After ensuring that you can log in using SSH keys, it\u0026rsquo;s a good security practice to disable password-based authentication.\nOpen the SSH configuration file on your VPS:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Find the following directives and change them as shown:\nPasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no This disables password login and root login, making your server more secure.\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nRestart the SSH service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh Step 4: Test SSH Key Login Before logging out of your current session, open a new terminal window and test the SSH key login:\nssh your_user@your_vps_ip_address ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/ssh-setup/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing SSH keys to access your Virtual Private Server (VPS) is one of the most secure methods of authentication.

U2 (Up Double): Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

As H. Spencer Lewis wisely observed:\n\u0026ldquo;Once we come to know that by the concentration of the mind on one point, on one principle, on one desire, a power is radiated to that point with creative nature and demonstrative abilities, we will think more carefully, more constructively and more efficiently.\u0026rdquo;\nThis statement is a reminder of the transformative potential that lies within focused thought. When we channel our mental energy toward a singular purpose or principle, we ignite a creative force that not only shapes our thoughts but also manifests in the world around us.\nConcentration is more than just a practice; it is a path to constructive and efficient thinking. It teaches us to direct our mental faculties with intention, avoiding the scattered nature of an unfocused mind. By honing in on what truly matters, we unlock the power to create, to demonstrate, and to bring our desires to fruition.\nAs we reflect on these words, let us consider how we can apply this wisdom in our daily lives. What is the one point, the one principle, or the one desire that you need to focus on? By aligning your thoughts and energy towards it, you may discover a new level of efficiency and creativity that drives you closer to your goals.\nTake a moment today to meditate on this insight and see where the power of focus can lead you.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/power-of-focus/","summary":"Reflecting on H.

You‚Äôre juggling multiple projects, receiving countless emails and messages across platforms, managing finances, maintaining personal health habits, and more.\nIt all piles up, and it can feel overwhelming. How do you keep up? How do you find focus and peace while getting things done when your plate is overflowing?\nIn this primer, I share key strategies and tactics to tackle an overloaded life with an open heart, renewed energy, and a smile.\nStep 1: Triage Whether you‚Äôre starting your day or caught in the chaos, the first step is triage mode‚Äîsorting through the mess to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.\nHere‚Äôs how:\nCreate a Short List for today: Identify tasks that must be done today, such as critical project work, urgent tasks with consequences if ignored, or small administrative tasks. Be ruthless‚Äîaim for no more than five tasks. Not every email needs a response, and not everything is urgent. Defer tasks: Push non-urgent tasks to tomorrow or later in the week. Renegotiate deadlines if possible to spread out the workload. Eliminate tasks: Skip low-priority messages or commitments. For tasks you can‚Äôt take on, add them to a ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list and plan to address them later (e.g., by declining or delegating). Now you have breathing room and a manageable list. Next, narrow it down further.\nStep 2: Focus on One Thing With so much on your plate, choosing one task to focus on feels daunting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs essential.\nHere‚Äôs the shift:\nPick one task: Review your Short List. If there‚Äôs an urgent, time-sensitive task, prioritize it. Otherwise, choose the most important task‚Äîoften the one you‚Äôve been avoiding. Clear distractions: Close browser tabs, turn off notifications, shut down unnecessary apps, and put your phone away. Immerse yourself: Focus entirely on the chosen task. Treat it as a practice of letting go of everything else, embracing radical simplicity, and being fully present. Work on this task for at least 15‚Äì20 minutes before switching. By focusing on one thing, you shift from a frazzled state to one of calm clarity.\nStep 3: Schedule Time to Simplify Your ‚ÄúTo Not Do‚Äù list needs attention. Schedule time this week to simplify your commitments:\nSay no to less important projects or tasks. Delegate or renegotiate commitments you can‚Äôt fulfill. Cross off low-priority items from your task list. Protecting your time for meaningful work and personal well-being reduces overwhelm. You don‚Äôt need to simplify today‚Äîjust schedule it and let go of the stress until then.\nStep 4: Practice Mindful Focus Adopt an attitude of ‚Äúmindful focus‚Äù throughout your day. Focus on one task at a time, staying present and minimizing task-switching.\nThink of this as a new mode of being‚Äîa mindfulness practice (imperfect but powerful). As you work through your Short List, approach each task with:\nAn open heart Curiosity and gratitude A sense of joy This mindset transforms your relationship with work. Each task becomes perfect for the moment, and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed.\nPeace, Love, Balance.\n‚òÆÔ∏è üíö ‚òØÔ∏è\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou have a to-do list that seems endless.
